This is a web-based implementation of the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock". The game is an extension of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" with two additional options added. The game is played between two players, in this case a user and a computer. Each player simultaneously chooses one of the five options: rock, paper, scissors, lizard, or Spock. The winner is determined by the following rules:

- Rock crushes Scissors
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Paper covers Rock
- Paper disproves Spock
- Lizard eats Paper
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Spock vaporizes Rock

If both players choose the same option, it's a tie.
